    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm Michelle Zhuang. I'm a software engineer at Cisco on the Capital IT team, supporting the financial payment solutions for leasing and loans of Cisco hardware and software products. Utilizing Agile methods, I collaborate cross functionally with Finance, Operations, and Accounting teams to deliver key business requirements. Built and deployed automated workflows using UiPath to improved test automation and efficiency by 10%. Developed and implemented PL/SQL packages to fetch contract details for data ingestion and integration with InfoLease. </p>
    <p>I am a graduate from Swarthmore College, double majoring in Engineering and Computer Science. At Swarthmore, I have previously served as the President of Women in Computer Science club (WiCS) on campus, building a community to empower other women with a passion for technology. My passion for community building doesn't stop there. I was also a Resident Assistant, managing administrative duties, such as budgeting, and fostering a community among a cohort of ethnically diverse undergraduate students.</p>

  <h2>A Passion to Create</h2>
  <p>Alongside my passion for technology, I have a passion to create. These passions of mine have motivated my project 
    for the Summer of 2021, where I hope to find an intersection of both - more information on that can be found in the navigation
    menu above!</p>
  <p>Another passion of mine is baking! While baking may seem irrelevant to the topics of technology and innovation, I believe it is a great way to express my strengths
    and show my capability for hands-on innovation (plus it is a deligiously rewarding treat). Baking depicts my determination and diligence
    as I recreate a recipe til I get it right - afterall, you know what they say: "Baking is a science." I also believe it depicts my creativity as I come up with recipes from what combinations of
    flavors and ingredients spark interest in me.</p>
